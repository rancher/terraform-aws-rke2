# Terraform AWS RKE2 All In One

This is a "Customized" example, showing how to control as many different options as possible in one deployment.
Our goal is to show how to tweak the deployment by setting many of the default options manually.

This example does not specify or enable features that the "Basic" example has,
  it simply specifies them rather than using the defaults.
